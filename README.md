# IA-SPGEMM

IA-SPGEMM is a An Input Auto-tuning Sparse General Matrix-Matrix Multiplication on Multicore and Manycore Architure. Currently
supported components include:

- SpGEMM algorithms for COO, DIA and ELL sparse storage format
- Feature extraction and density representation
- MatNet (mix CNN and BP)

All tests default calculate the square of A for matrix inputs. 

The tool extracts all of the features and density representation as MatNet inputs.

It is easy to use and provide unified interface.

## Getting Started
In IA-SPGEMM system, the goal is to search an optimal format and algorithm that minimizes computing overhead.

Setting up an IA-SPGEMM is easy.

(1) run SpGEMM code on CPU with auto-tuning in double precision  
```bash
cd ./IA-SPGEMM-CPU_release;
make;
./spgemm-cpu Inputs/dia.mtx;
```

(2) run SpGEMM code on GPU with auto-tuning in double precision  
```bash
cd ./IA-SPGEMM-GPU_release;
make;
./spgemm-gpu Inputs/dia.mtx;
```
